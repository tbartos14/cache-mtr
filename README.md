# Cache MTR

This is a 'lightweight' simulator for evaluating the performance of simple caching algorithms. At the moment, this only consists of chosen user caching distributions relative to a known caching distribution. As inputs,

A simple example would be a tilted caching distribution with scaling factor ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Calpha):

## Notes
* Notably, CacheMTR supports _LaTeX_ formula inputs with some nuance. See instructions for use and restrictions.
* Efficiency is in the works, most noticeable with simulations demanding >10,000 cache/request choices.
* Thank you to [QuickLatex](https://quicklatex.com/) for a simple and dependable API for generating UI renders of _LaTeX_, far simpler than making renders in-house with existing libraries.
